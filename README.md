# Install Wireshark and libpcap:
``` sh
sudo apt-get install wireshark libpcap0.8
```
# Reconfigure wireshark to allow non-superusers to track packets:
``` sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
```
- press `yes`

# Add your username to the "wireshark" usergroup:
``` sh
sudo usermod -a -G wireshark <your_username>
```
- To check if itâ€™s done correctly by displaying the groups your username is part of: `groups <your_username>`
- If not, you can add the group "wireshark" manually: `groupadd wireshark`
- And then add your username to the group
- Important: Logout of your session, then log back in.

# This step depends on the kernel version that is installed on your machine. To know the version of your kernel, type:

    uname -r

    For versions of the kernel prior to 2.6.21, if debugfs is not already mounted on /sys/kernel/debug, ensure that it is mounted there by issuing the following command:

    sudo mount -t debugfs / /sys/kernel/debug

For kernel version 2.6.21 and later, load the loadable module usbmon in the Kernel:

`sudo modprobe usbmon`

See [Wireshark Wiki](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB#Linux) for more information about this differentiation.

    If the usbmon interfaces don't appear in Wireshark, look for interfaces using dumpcap (the command-line tool of Wireshark):

    sudo dumpcap -D

    You should see the usbmon* interfaces. Now display the permissions of the usbmon interfaces:

    ls -l /dev/usbmon*

    If the usbmon* files have 'crw-------', then it's normal that Wireshark cannot read them because it's not run as root. Do not execute wireshark in root mode, it may damage files. Instead, you can give it regular users privileges :

    sudo setfacl -m u:$USER:r /dev/usbmon*

Now the usbmon interfaces should appear in Wireshark.
